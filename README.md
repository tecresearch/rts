# 🧩 Perishable Inventory Optimization System

## 📌 Problem Statement

A food manufacturing and distribution company produces **perishable items** that expire within **1–2 days**. These items are:

- **Highly popular and quickly sold** in some stores
- **Slow-moving** in others

Due to a **lack of real-time tracking**, unsold items are often identified **too late**, and by the time redistribution is considered, the items have **already expired** — resulting in **waste and financial loss**.

Moreover, there is **no fixed demand pattern** across stores, which makes inventory management and demand forecasting even more challenging.

## ✅ Stagewise Solution

### Stage 1: Solution Architecture

**Goal**: Implement a real-time inventory and demand tracking ecosystem.

#### Key Components:

- **IoT Devices**: Track real-time stock levels of perishable items in each store.
- **Cloud Server**: Centralized platform for storing and processing inventory data.
- **Inventory Management System**: Tracks item location, shelf life, and availability across stores.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts item demand based on historical data, seasonal trends, and day-of-week variations.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visual interface to show items nearing expiry and demand hotspots.
- **Alert System**: Sends automated notifications for item transfers or applying discounts.

### Stage 2: High-Level Design

1. **Smart Shelves / Barcode Scanners** update item inventory in real time.
2. **Real-time data** is pushed to a **central cloud-based system**.
3. The system uses **machine learning** to analyze trends and predict demand.
4. The model identifies **overstocked vs. understocked** locations.
5. The dashboard alerts the admin with:
   - 🔄 **Transfer Suggestions** (e.g., Store A → Store B)
   - ⚠️ **Expiry Warnings**
   - 💸 **Dynamic Discount Recommendations** for last-minute sales

```
### Stage 3: Detailed Flow (Text-Based Flowchart)
1. Food Item Arrives at Store ↓


2. Inventory Data Sent to Central System ↓


3. Demand Prediction & Expiry Monitoring ↓


4. If Item Not Likely to Sell in Time: ↓ a. Identify High-Demand Nearby Store ↓ b. Notify Admin to Transfer Item ↓ c. Generate Transfer Order ↓ d. Track and Confirm Delivery ↓


5. If No Store Available: → Apply Discount → Notify Local Customers for Instant Sale

```

## 🏁 Final Outcome

With this system in place:

- ✅ Perishable items are **sold before expiring**, minimizing waste.
- ✅ Admin has **real-time visibility** into inventory and demand.
- ✅ Customers in high-demand areas **always find stock**.
- ✅ The business experiences **cost savings** and improved operational efficiency.
